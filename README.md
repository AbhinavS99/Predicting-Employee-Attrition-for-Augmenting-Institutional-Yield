Employee Attrition can be defined as the natural process in which the employees of an organization or an institution leave the workforce and are not immediately replaced. The reason for attrition can range from personal reasons such as low salaries to hostile work environments. Employee attrition can be categorized into two categories, viz Voluntary Attrition and Involuntary Attrition. Voluntary attrition implies that the employee leaves an organization due to personal reasons. On the other hand, involuntary attrition occurs when an employee is removed from the organization due to low productivity or other reasons. Loss of employees via attrition has severe impacts on the yield of an organization. Finding eligible candidates to replace the ones that have left is a daunting task. This not only leads to higher costs but also induces a relatively inexperienced workforce in the organization. Continuous employee loss also disrupts the work chain and leads to delayed deadlines and lower customer satisfaction. Higher employee attrition diminishes the brand value of an organization.
