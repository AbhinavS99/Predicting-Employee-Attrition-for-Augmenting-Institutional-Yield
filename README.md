# Predicting-Employee-Attrition-for-Augmenting-Institutional-Yield

The developing interests in machine learning principles among business pioneers and leaders request that analysts investigate its utilization inside business associations. The loss of talented employees is detrimental to both the morale and the institutional yield. This project studies the trends in employee attrition and predicts the same using machine learning principles.

<h2>Introduction</h2>
Employee Attrition can be defined as the natural process in which the employees of an organization or an institution leave the workforce and are not immediately replaced. The reason for attrition can range from personal reasons such as low salaries to hostile work environments. Employee attrition can be categorized into two categories, viz Voluntary Attrition and Involuntary Attrition. In this project, the team strives to use machine learning principles to predict employee attrition, provide managerial insights to prevent attrition, and finally rule out and present the factors that lead to attrition. The project employs the use of models like Logistic Regression, Naive Bayes Classifier, Decision Trees, Random Forests, SVM and Multi Layer Perceptron on an IBM Watson generated synthetic data set.

<h2>Methodology</h2>
The data-set is highly imbalanced, therefore, for all classification algorithms three separate instances of data-set are prepared viz baseline(without any change), up-sampling (the minority class using SMOTE) and down-sampling (the majority class using sklearn resample). Then the classification methods are applied on all the three instances. The classification techniques that have been used within the domain of the project are Logistic Regression, Gaussian Naive Bayes, Decision Tree Classifier, Random Forest Classifier, erceptron, Multi-Layer Perceptron and SVM/SVC.
